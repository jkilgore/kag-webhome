        <div class="container">
            <p class="value-statement">Technology drives every part of your organization—but without clear leadership, it can slow growth instead of fueling it. A Fractional CTO bridges that gap, bringing senior-level expertise, structure, and accountability without the cost of a full-time executive. With Kilgore Advisory Group, your teams gain a trusted technology leader who clarifies priorities, drives measurable progress, and ensures every initiative supports your strategic goals.</p>

                    <h2>Meet Your Fractional CTO</h2>
                    <p>I started Kilgore Advisory Group after years leading technology for hospitals and small financial institutions — organizations where compliance, security, and efficiency aren't optional. Drawing on a deep consulting background, I developed the Functional Technology® Framework, a proven approach to modernizing systems, strengthening cybersecurity, and helping teams scale with confidence.</p>
                    <p>Ever since, I've guided clients through everything from EHR rollouts and core system upgrades to complex modernization and migration efforts—always with a focus on clear strategy, measurable results, and sustainable growth.</p>
